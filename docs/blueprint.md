# **App Name**: CivicAI

## Core Features:

- AI Image Analysis: Leverage Google Vision API to automatically identify civic issues from uploaded images, determining the issue type, severity, and providing a descriptive summary. The AI should function as a tool to determine which piece of information should be incorporated into the summary.

- Authority Dashboard: Provide a web interface for authorities to view submitted reports, filter by severity or location, update statuses (In Progress/Resolved), and upload verification photos.
- Role-Based Access Control: Implement Firebase Authentication to manage user sign-up/sign-in and enforce role-based access control, differentiating between citizen and authority users.
- Report Status Updates: Enable authorities to update the status of reported issues, triggering notifications to the reporting citizen via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or email.
- Image Upload and Storage: Allow citizens to upload images of civic issues via a mobile/web interface, storing the images in Firebase Storage.
- Real-time Notifications: Send push notifications or SMS alerts to citizens when their reports are updated or resolved, and notify authorities of new high-severity reports.
